## My process

### Built with

- React
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this project, I have learned with deeper clarity the value of careful planning for responsive design. Comparing the high-fidelity design mockups on Figma across the various screen sizes reveals subtle ways in which the elements change orientation or position, making the solution more challenging. Working on a mobile-first approach would often throw up headaches when needing to responsively change the design at larger sizes. Working on this project has given me a greater understanding of this and will be of great benifit to me in the future. 

### Continued development

To go further with this, I would like to incorporate image hosting and make the project full stack to practice handling files from an external server. I would also experiment with alternative ways of styling projects. Up to now I almost always work with adjacent css files imported into my components however, I am aware that there are a myriad of other ways to do this such as styled components for example. A more efficient styling method may be out there, I would like to expand my repertoire of techniques.
